## Description
 The Team Profile Generator Application is a command line app that generates a Team Profile. This applicaton uses npm inquirer and jest packages to prompt for user inputs and then dynamically creates and renders a html file with their respones. This project uses Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development as it's foundation. This application enabled me to build upon and practice my knowledge in the prototype chain and polymorphism. Each class.js file has a corresponding test.js file that pass all tests. This project helped me learn and practice the principles of Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development
